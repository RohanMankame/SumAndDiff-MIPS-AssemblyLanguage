# SumAndDiff-MIPS-AssemblyLanguage

A assembly language program made in MARS using MIPS. Done for my CMPSC 312 class on computer organization and architecture.

Purpose: This program prompts a user to enter three integers,
computes the difference between the sum of the two largestintegers and the smallest integer,
then displays the result.

This simple programs gave me clear insight into how assemblers work
