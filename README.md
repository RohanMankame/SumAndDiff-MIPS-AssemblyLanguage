# Difference Program (MIPS Assembly)

This program, written in MIPS assembly language, calculates the difference between the sum of the two largest integers and the smallest integer among three user-provided inputs.  It's designed to run on the MARS 4.5 simulator.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter three integer values (x, y, and z). It then determines the smallest of the three and calculates the difference between the sum of the other two and the smallest value. Finally, it displays the calculated difference to the user.

## Build Instructions

1.  **Install MARS:** Download and install the MARS 4.5 simulator (or a compatible version).  You can usually find this through a web search for "MARS MIPS simulator".

2.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):** If you've cloned this repository, navigate to the project directory.

3.  **Open in MARS:** Open the `DifferenceProgram.asm` file in the MARS simulator.

4.  **Assemble:** In the MARS simulator, click the "Assemble" button (or use the appropriate menu option).

5.  **Run:** After successful assembly, click the "Run" button (or use the appropriate menu option) to execute the program.

## Usage

When the program runs in MARS, it will prompt you to enter three integer values:

1.  Enter the value for x and press Enter.
2.  Enter the value for y and press Enter.
3.  Enter the value for z and press Enter.

The program will then calculate the difference and display the result.
